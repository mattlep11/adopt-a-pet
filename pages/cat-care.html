    <h1>A Beginner's Guide to Cat Care</h1>
    <section>
      <h2 class="section-header">Information for New Cat Owners</h2>
      <p>
        One of the first steps as a new cat owner is to schedule a veterinary examination. This allows for a thorough health check-up, discussion of routine healthcare such as vaccinations and parasite prevention, and addressing any concerns about cat behavior or medical care.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's also important to understand that cats have unique personalities and behaviors. Some may be shy, while others may be outgoing and constantly seeking attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        New cats can come with various health issues depending on their previous environment, so it's crucial to be aware of potential health problems and address them promptly. Patience is key when it comes to new pets. Adjusting to a new environment can be stressful for a cat, so giving them the time they need to adjust is essential.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, cats are territorial animals and prefer to have their own space. Respecting their space and letting them come to you when they're ready can help build a strong and lasting bond. Remember, every cat is unique and may require different care. Always consult with a veterinarian or a cat behaviorist if you have any concerns or questions about your new feline friend.

          <h2 class="section-header">Your Cat's Diet</h2>
          <p>
            Becoming a cat owner for the first time can be an exciting yet overwhelming experience. One of the key aspects to focus on is your cat's dietary needs. Cats are carnivores and their diet should be rich in animal protein. It's crucial to choose a high-quality food that is appropriate for their age and lifestyle, as nutritional needs can vary.
          </p>
          <p>
            For instance, kittens have different nutritional requirements compared to adult cats. Both wet and dry foods have their benefits. Wet food aids in hydration but can't be left out for long, while dry food is easier to store and promotes dental hygiene.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you decide to change your cat's diet, do it gradually over a week to avoid upsetting their stomach. Also, cats prefer their water and food sources to be separate, mimicking their natural behavior to avoid contamination.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, remember that cats are excellent at conserving water, so don't be alarmed if you don't see your cat drinking much, especially if they're on a wet food diet.

      <h2 class="section-header">Preparing Your Home for a Cat</h2>
      <p>
          When preparing your home for a new cat, it's important to consider the following steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Safe Space: Initially, confine your cat to a small room with all the essentials like food, water, a litter box, a cat bed, and some toys. This will help them adjust to their new environment without feeling overwhelmed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gradual Introduction: Slowly introduce your cat to the rest of the house. This gradual introduction helps them get accustomed to their new surroundings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cat-Proofing: Before letting your cat explore the rest of the house, ensure it's cat-safe1. Look out for fragile objects, small gaps, electrical wires, and unsecured furniture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Litter Tray: If you know what type of litter your new cat was using before, start with that at home. Cats tend to form strong preferences for what substrate they use.
        </li>
      </ol>
